My project on "3D-Bioprinted PCL/GelMA-HA Scaffolds for Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)"  

Here, we developed a novel, biocompatible, and biodegradable 3D printed scaffold for the purpose of surgical implantation and guided bone regeneration in patients with periodontitis (an extreme form of gingivitis involving severe recession of gums and enamel).  

Project outline:  
1. Design unique scaffolds using SOLIDWORKS CAD.
2. 3D print scaffolds using polycaprolactone (PCL)
3. Perform low-temperature plasma (LTP) treatment to alter the surface chemistry of the scaffolds for enhanced biocompatability
4. Electrospin a second, thin layer of PCL to mimic the tissue structure
5. Synthesize a hydrogel for infiltration of scaffolds
6. Infiltrate scaffolds with liquid hydrogel, then photopolymerize the gel with UV cross-linking
7. Perform analyses on scaffolds such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR, rheology, and water contact angle
8. Perform cell-viability assays on scaffolds to determine biocompatibility

We successfully completed this project, discovering novel effects of LTP treatment on photopolymerization of hydrogel, leading to weakened structural integrity of infiltrated scaffolds.
