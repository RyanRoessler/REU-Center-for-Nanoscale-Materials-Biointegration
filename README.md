My research experience for undergraduates (REU) project: *3D-Bioprinted PCL/GelMA-HA Scaffolds for Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)*  

University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB): Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration  

Here, we developed a novel, biocompatible, and biodegradable 3D printed scaffold for the purpose of surgical implantation and guided bone regeneration in patients with periodontitis (an extreme form of gingivitis involving severe recession of gums and enamel).  

Project outline:  
1. Designed unique scaffolds using SOLIDWORKS CAD.
2. 3D printed scaffolds using polycaprolactone (PCL)
3. Performed low-temperature plasma (LTP) treatment to alter the surface chemistry of the scaffolds for enhanced biocompatability
4. Electrospun a second, thin layer of PCL to mimic the tissue structure
5. Synthesized a hydrogel for infiltration of scaffolds
6. Infiltrated scaffolds with liquid hydrogel, then photopolymerized the gel with UV cross-linking
7. Performed analyses on scaffolds such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR, rheology, and water contact angle
8. Performed cell-viability assays (MTT) on scaffolds to determine biocompatibility

We successfully completed this project, discovering novel effects of LTP treatment on photopolymerization of hydrogel, leading to weakened structural integrity of infiltrated scaffolds.
